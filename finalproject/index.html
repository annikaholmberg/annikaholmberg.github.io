		<h1>How Admissions to Substance Abuse Programs in New York State Have Evolved</h1>

    <p class="byline"> By: Annika Holmberg </p>

    <p> December 15, 2022 </p>

		<p>
			Over the last 20 years, the opioid crisis has worsened as more and more Americans become addicted to drugs. Nonetheless, other substances being used such as cocaine, alcohol, and marijuana continue to skyrocket. Taking a look at New York state specifically, substance abuse programs have received more and more admissions per year spanning from 2007 to 2021.
		</p>

    <p>
		Using data from NY Open Data provided by the Office of Addiction Services and Support, the data includes admission types, which substance was involved, as well as age groups separated by counties in New York. Certain counties have seen more admissions as compared to others, but a few trends are certainly present across the data set. These include but are not limited to patterns across certain counties, increases or decreases in certain substances, as well as overall connections to happenings in the world such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
		</p>

    <p> 
      Substance abuse is a very sensitive topic that does not discriminate against people - it can affect anyone regardless of their age, socioeconomic status, race, or gender. Raising awareness and showing that instances like this or more common than previously thought will help people be aware of the resources available to them and how they can seek help.

			As a Syracuse University student in Onondaga County, the chart below tracks all admissions to county substance use treatment centers ranging from 2007-2021.

  <div class="column">
    <iframe title="Substance Use Treatment Center Admissions in Onondaga County" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-kmcqH" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kmcqH/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="445" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
  
  <p>
    The two most prominent substances used by New Yorkers in Onondaga County are heroin and alcohol. When comparing alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana, the trend is extremely similar - the data begins at a high value but then continues on a downward trend. In terms of heroin and other opioids however, the data starts at a lower value, hits a peak, and then begins a downward trend. 
  </p>

  <p>
    When looking at alcohol admissions, an important thing to keep in mind is that two universities are present within the county - Syracuse University and Le Moyne College. As popularly known among many people, many young adults in college experiment with alcohol. Another facet of this data is that a multitude of the admissions to alcohol treatment programs may be students at the university, as the sum of admissions of 18-24 year olds to alcohol treatment programs is 5,324 - around 10% of the total admissions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taking a look at the opiods in Onondaga county, a national report from the CDC tracking the dispensing of opioids in the United States describes how “The overall national opioid dispensing rate declined from 2012 to 2020, and in 2020, the dispensing rate had fallen to the lowest in the 15 years, for which we have data at 43.3 prescriptions per 100 persons (total of more than 142 million opioid prescriptions)” (Centers for Disease Control, 2021). While the numbers may be on the decline, the number of Americans being prescribed opioids in light of this epidemic is still staggering, and everyday people overdose on these drugs.
  </p>

  <p>Out of all substances documented, heroin reached one of the higher points in 2016, just a year before being declared a public health emergency. Polly Gardiner, a former Licensed Clinical Social Worker, LMSW, at New York Presbyterian Hospital worked closely with individuals suffering from mental illness. Gardiner spoke about the close relation between substance abuse and mental illness. "When working in the hospital, several of the adult patients with mental illness often also suffered from substance abuse issues. It's a common comorbidity." Further speaking on the close correlation, Gardiner mentioned how those struggling with mental health are often more susceptible to developing addictions to substances such as alcohol or opioids.</p>

 <p>
    In a study conducted by the NY Health Foundation in 2017, they found that “Counties with higher opioid prescribing tend to cluster in the Western and Hudson Valley Regions” (NY Health Foundation, 2017). While this study was done five years ago, the data in both of these maps displays this as well, with clear changes between data found in 2007 compared to data found in 2021.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another interesting aspect comparing these two maps is that areas in 2007 with the highest amounts of opioid use have only increased in substance use treatment admissions. A possible reasoning for this increase is the COVID-19 pandemic - isolating environments and increased mental and financial stress led more and more Americans to gravitate towards using prescription drugs. In an article released in 2021, the American Medical Association reported that “40 U.S. states have seen increases in opioid-related mortality along with ongoing concerns for those with substance use disorders” (American Psychological Association, 2021). New York has certainly seen an uptick in substance use admissions consistent with these findings.

      <p>While national totals of alcoholism have decreased, a statistic from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism states that only 10% of the US population will receive help for alcohol-related issues. Taking a look closer at New York State, 10% of the total population of roughly 19,840,000 people equals 1,984,000. The total number of admissions for alcohol abuse programs in the state of New York equals 1,740,763. While not completely 10% of the total population, it’s important to take into account the growing population numbers and how that may add some variations into this total number. All in all, this total number is within a few deviations of that 10%, and stays consistent with the national total of alcohol-related admissions.</p>

      <p>As mentioned above, the COVID-19 pandemic created environments for Americans that would lead them to turn to alcohol or drugs. While these numbers may have increased, a lot of treatment facilities were forced to shut down or move into virtual programming. For some individuals who needed help, they were unable to do so and this may have caused them to suffer more or never receive any treatment. </p>

      <p>Gardiner also added how "on it's own, the increase in mental illness during COVID greatly increased the risk of many individuals to abuse substances." Isolating environments accompanied by financial strain and other stressors has long been a trigger for alcohol abuse.</p> 
    </div>

    <p>As the COVID-19 pandemic moves into its later stages, substance abuse is still a lasting problem. Unfortunately, this issue is not just in New York State across the country. While campaigns to spread awareness and health warnings have been created to inform the public, education on resources for every American should be available.</p>
